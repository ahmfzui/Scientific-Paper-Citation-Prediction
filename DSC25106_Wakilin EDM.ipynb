        "- **Data Cleaning & Feature Preprocessing**: Managing missing values, dropping irrelevant features, scaling data, and addressing class imbalance using **SMOTE** and downsampling.\n",

        "- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Applying **Optuna** for optimized parameter search to boost performance.\n",
        "- **Final Prediction & Submission**: Making test predictions and exporting to submission format.\n",
